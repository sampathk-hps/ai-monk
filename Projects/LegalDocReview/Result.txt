* Accurately reporting usage or revenue

The payment structure typically consists of:

**Additional Context:**
The Licensing Agreement also outlines the obligations of the Licensor, which include granting access to the licensed rights, maintaining ownership of the intellectual property, and refraining from interfering with authorized use. The agreement also includes detailed provisions on standard licensing practices, compliance obligations, risk allocation, enforcement mechanisms, dispute resolution, indemnification, limitation of liability, governing law, assignment restrictions, and force majeure. These provisions aim to provide legal clarity, reduce ambiguity, and ensure the agreement remains enforceable across multiple jurisdictions.
